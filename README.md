Base Cross-Chain Bridge

📋 Project Description
Base Cross-Chain Bridge is a decentralized bridge that enables seamless token transfers between different blockchain networks, specifically designed for the Base ecosystem. This bridge facilitates cross-chain liquidity and interoperability while maintaining security and decentralization.

🛠️ Smart Contract Functions

Core Functions:
initiateBridge(uint256 chainId, address receiver, address token, uint256 amount) - Initiate cross-chain transfer
completeBridge(uint256 transactionId, bytes32 txHash, uint256 chainId) - Complete cross-chain transaction
registerChain(uint256 chainId, address bridgeContract, bool enabled) - Register new blockchain network
setFeePercentage(uint256 fee) - Set transaction fee percentage
getBridgeStats() - Get bridge statistics

Events:
TransactionInitiated - Emitted when cross-chain transaction is initiated
TransactionCompleted - Emitted when transaction is completed
ChainRegistered - Emitted when new chain is registered
FeeUpdated - Emitted when fee is updated
LiquidityAdded - Emitted when liquidity is added


📊 Contract Structure
Transaction Structure:
struct CrossChainTransaction {
    uint256 transactionId;
    address sender;
    address receiver;
    address token;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 chainId;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool completed;
    bool cancelled;
}
Chain Configuration:

struct ChainConfig {
    bool enabled;
    address bridgeContract;
    uint256 gasLimit;
    uint256 fee;
}

⚡ Deployment Process
Prerequisites:

🔒 Security Considerations
Security Measures:
Multi-Signature - Require multiple signatures for critical operations
Reentrancy Protection - Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
Input Validation - Comprehensive input validation
Access Control - Role-based access control
Transaction Verification - Double-check transaction integrity
Emergency Pause - Emergency pause mechanism
Audit Status:
Initial security audit completed
Formal verification in progress
Community review underway
